# Blood-Donation-Database-System
This project aims to help with managing the accessibility of blood donation processes for both donors and recipients. The system will function as an efficient system to store data of donors including blood group, compatibility, shelf life of donated blood, location data, and other necessary details essential for the management system. It will help in efficient matching of donors with recipients and optimising blood availability.
The system will be implemented using SQL databases and web-based technologies. The frontend will be developed using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and other modern frameworks to provide a user-friendly interface. The backend will handle the request processing and database storage using SQL. By digitizing the blood donation processes, this system enhances the efficiency of blood banks in hospitals, ultimately contributing to saving lives.
